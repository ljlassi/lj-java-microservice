I'm building a Java microservice here to communicate with a PHP application through a REST API. The idea is that this future microservice stores user information, handles it and manages authentication.

Very much work in progress, by the time I'm writing this, has a functional user model, loads local config file with DB credentials, connects to a MySQL database and is able to add a user to database.

I have yet to add unit tests etc.
